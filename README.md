# Teach Small Basic

**Programs for teaching Small Basic to beginning programmers**

Students start with "recipes", which are Small Basic programs consisting step-by-step English instructions in the form of program comments. The teacher helps the students learn to create actual programs using the recipes as a starting point. As the programs become more advanced, the recipes become more abstract, moving to higher level descriptions of multiple lines of code and then to summaries of entire methods.

The programs are organized into a series of 10 lessons. The amount of material introduced in each lesson is designed for 90 minutes of instruction per lesson (a 15 minute break is recommended).

There are Small Basic files for recipes and finished programs, some with multiple iterations. Teachers should feel free to help the class make more enhancements as a group and to encourage students to invent still more enhancements individually. Using iterations helps reinforce concepts while exemplifying the creative potential of programming. Some recipes leave room for improvement, which the teacher can help students discover, for example input error checking.

The file name convention is like this:

* `Bubbles 1 Recipe.sb` - the recipe for the first iteration of the Bubbles program
* `Bubbles 1.sb` - the completed Bubbles program (first iteration)
* `Bubbles 2 Recipe.sb` - the recipe for another iteration of the Bubbles program
* `Bubbles 2.sb` - the completed Bubbles program (second iteration)


## Lessons

### Lessons 8, 9, and 10: Word Guesser

You try to guess a randomly chooses a word given a definition and picture.

New concepts:

* Grid layout
* UI Controls
* String manipulation

* Animation

As a bonus for the last lesson, a teacher can choose his favorite into application in a "real" language, and demo it to encourage the students to continue the journey.

## Call On

Often students are shy about volunteering what they know, especially when they are uncertain. The "Call On" program is a fun way to randomly choose a student to call on to answer a question. To use it, customize `Call On.sb` by changing the number of student and call items in their respective arrays to match your class, and set the name and preferred bugle call for each student.
